Dear graders, first of all thanks for this great program - I really enjoyed it and it allowed me to dive deep into interesting use cases using Azure.

A word of caution: I wasn't able to find the correct versions of the Threat Modeling app in conjunction with the correct Azure template that would give me exactly the needed services. I tried many combinations but didn't succeed. For example there were no stencils for MQTT data flows, and choosing another template would allow for MQTT data flow, but not give me another service I need. 

In terms of the threat modeling itself and the mitigations of risks: I did some mitigations as examples, but didn't go through all of them one by one (mostly then labeled as "to be investigated"). My understanding is that we understand how to do threat modeling, but not dive deep into a whole different matter of cloud and software security.

Thanks and best regards
